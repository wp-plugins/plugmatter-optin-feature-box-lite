<h3>What is an Optin Feature Box?</h3>

An optin feature box is an email optin box that sits right under the header of your WordPress site but above the content. Using an optin feature box, you can easily grab the attention of your visitors and convert them into email subscribers.

<h3>Why Use an Optin Feature Box?</h3>

Simply because an email subscription box featured above the fold grabs the most attention and converts really well. When your visitors visit your site, the first and the most important thing to do is grab their email address. And that’s exactly what an optin feature box lets you do.

<h3>How Do You Create an Optin Feature Box?</h3>

You can either hire an expensive designer to design/code a professional feature box OR download and install the Optin Feature Box plugin from Plugmatter for free. It saves you time, money and gives you what you need to boost your list building efforts.
